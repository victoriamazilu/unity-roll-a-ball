# Roll-a-Ball Unity Project ðŸš€

Welcome to the **Roll-a-Ball** project! This repository is a simple game where the player controls a ball to collect objects within a bounded area that I'm using to learn Unity and C#.

## Project Overview

In the **Roll-a-Ball** game, the player moves a ball around a playfield, collecting pick-up objects while avoiding boundaries. The game introduces fundamental Unity concepts such as:

- GameObjects and Components
- Physics and Rigidbodies
- Basic Scripting in C#
- Input Handling
- Creating a simple UI to display player stats
